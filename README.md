web2book
========

A web scraper/document converter that outputs to e-book readers.

This is a project I created back in 2006/7 when I got an early Sony 
e-book reader. It was quite popular at the time, but after I sold
my reader it stagnated. Kovid Goyal encouraged me to implement it 
in Python instead of C# to make it cross-platform, but at the time I
didn't know Python. So he went ahead and made his own, web2disk, which
gradually evolved into the now well known Calibre (https://calibre-ebook.com/)
which is awesome and I use a lot.
